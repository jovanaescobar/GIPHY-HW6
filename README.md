GIPHY API ASSIGNMENT

- Utilizing the Giphy Api - this is an interactive site where you can select from the premade button options displayed, or create your own buttons that populate gif's.

- Each button listed is related to a cartoon from the 90's - 2000's that will populate GIF's associated to the cartoon/word in the button, along with that image rating.

 - Clicking on each of the gif's will allow them to play/pause.

- The input area allows you to create your own button - either of a new cartoon - or anything at all. Once the submission is made and that new button appears, it will have the same fuinction of populating gif's!
